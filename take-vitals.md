The form to take vitals will open. Here you have to click on the "Rebre dades del tensiòmetre" button to take the blood pressure measurements from the patient, and then click on the "Rebre pes de la bàscula" to take the weight from the scale. The height of the patient can be manually introduced on the "Height" text box.
